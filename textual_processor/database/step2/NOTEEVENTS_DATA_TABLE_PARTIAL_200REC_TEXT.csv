Per review of OSH records:  Patient presented to OSH with
complaints of [**2-29**] days of cough and dyspnea.  On the day prior
to transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset
of worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by
the time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a
pulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.
.
At the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She
was given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several
hundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,
requiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a
possible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of 29.  An echo
done at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly
preserved LVEF.
.
In speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six
months the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.
She was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was
felt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home
environment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over
the last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought
to her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes
had contained mold and were the precipitant for her current
exacerbation.

dyspnea on exertion.  He was noted to have an ejection
fraction of greater than 60 percent in [**3058-6-20**].  The
patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of
arrival with PCI to the native RCA and 4 stents and
brachytherapy to the vein graft.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and approximately 6 hours later developed a
chest pain noted as 4 out of 10 substernal radiating to his
throat and back without shortness of breath, diaphoresis,
nausea or vomiting.  EKG at that time revealed ST elevation
in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was brought back to the
catheterization laboratory at that time.  They found that the
SVG to PL have been thrombosed.  The artery was opened in the
catheterization laboratory, AngioJet had been unsuccessful
and the graft was opened with Nipride with subsequent TIMI 3
flow.  The patient had persistently occluded communication
between the native RCA and the vein graft.  Postprocedure,
after the sheath pull, a hematoma developed and the patient
had baseline low blood pressure of systolic in the 90s.
