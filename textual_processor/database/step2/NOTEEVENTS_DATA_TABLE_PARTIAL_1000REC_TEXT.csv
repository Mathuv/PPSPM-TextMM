Per review of OSH records:  Patient presented to OSH with
complaints of [**2-29**] days of cough and dyspnea.  On the day prior
to transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset
of worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by
the time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a
pulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.
.
At the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She
was given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several
hundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,
requiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a
possible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of 29.  An echo
done at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly
preserved LVEF.
.
In speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six
months the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.
She was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was
felt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home
environment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over
the last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought
to her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes
had contained mold and were the precipitant for her current
exacerbation.

dyspnea on exertion.  He was noted to have an ejection
fraction of greater than 60 percent in [**3058-6-20**].  The
patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of
arrival with PCI to the native RCA and 4 stents and
brachytherapy to the vein graft.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and approximately 6 hours later developed a
chest pain noted as 4 out of 10 substernal radiating to his
throat and back without shortness of breath, diaphoresis,
nausea or vomiting.  EKG at that time revealed ST elevation

catheterization laboratory, AngioJet had been unsuccessful
and the graft was opened with Nipride with subsequent TIMI 3
flow.  The patient had persistently occluded communication
between the native RCA and the vein graft.  Postprocedure,

CHOP and RICE. He developed a biliary stricture and common
hepatic duct obstruction and underwent ERCP and stent placement
in [**3492-9-19**] and [**3493-7-20**]. Those stents were removed. In
[**3496-2-20**], he presented with fever and elevated LFTs. He had
an ERCP at that time and was subsequently referred to [**Hospital1 18**]
where he underwent an ERCP on [**3-12**]. This demonstrated the
presence of an existing plastic stent that was blocked with
sludge and was removed. He had small stone fragments and pus
that were seen extruding from the common duct once the stent was
removed. There was a long benign-appearing stricture of the
common bile duct and common hepatic duct with dilatation of the
intrahepatic ducts proximally. Cytology was negative. Since
then, he has undergone several follow-up ERCPs and dilatation.
He has also undergone repeated brushings for cytology that have
all been benign.

HIV/AIDS who presented to the ED after a week long history of
high grade fevers and worseing dyspnea with exertion. The
patient was diagnosed in [**3470**] with HIV and has been on and off
HAART therapy since that time. Most recently, he was on steady
treatment for 3 years until this spring when he decided to take
a self decided medication holiday. He reports he has not taken
HAART medications in about 6 months. About 2-3 months ago the
patient also started having watery diarrhea intermittently [**2-10**]
times weekly. About one and a half weeks ago, he started
noticing high fevers and night sweats. The diarrhea worsened and
instead of having it on and off, it became constant. The fevers
also continued to worsen and peaked at a temp of 103.6 today,
the morning of his admission. Two days prior to admission he
started noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s
climbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a
non-productive dry cough and some chest ""tightness"" associated
with this increased work of breathing. He could barely walk from
the kitchen back and forth to the couch due to his dyspnea. He
has also noticed daily headaches. He denies neck
stiffness/rigidity, photophobia or any new skin rashes. He
describes some mild blurry vision when he would try to focus on
[**Location (un) 1116**] but this would subside after a minute or so. He now
complains of diffuse weakness and lightheadedness today. He
denies any syncope. Of note, he has lost about 25 pounds over
the last couple months which he attributes to a decreased
appetite and his diarrhea issues.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 97/56, P 98, R 22, 85%

received 1000 mg IV  Vancomycin, 750 mg PO Levofloxacin, and 40
mg oral [**Location (un) 2723**]. He was ordered for Pentamidine 225 mg but
did not receive it in the ED. An ABG was done and showed a low
pO2 of 72. CXR showed multiple small patchy opacities
bilaterally which were immediately concerning for PCP.

was eventually comfortable on [**4-13**] L NC O2 but noticed he got
very winded walking to and from the bathroom. He denied any
nausea, vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea on day of
admission. He still felt weak ""all over"" and had diffuse muscle
aches. No headaches on arrival to floor. The patient had an
acute exacerbation of his shortness of breath with associated
tachypnea and tachycardia soon after admission to the medical
floor. This acute episode of respiratory distress was soon after
an induced sputum sample and thus, likely due to associated
bronchospasms. The patient was hypoxic on labs and was therefore
transferred to the MICU for a brief one day stay in order to
watch his airway closely while he improved. Fortunately, he
improved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high
flow supplemental oxygen. He did not require any intubations. He
was transferred back to the general medical floor once he was
more hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L
oxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95%

398,"61y/o M w/ DM2, CHF s/p ICD, CRI, and atrial fibrillation
presenting today with altered mental status and hypotension. The
patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in mid-[**Month (only) 1082**] with a
perirectal abscess complicated by hypotension and a MICU
admission. His course was further complicated by renal failure
and a transaminitis attributed to unasyn therapy. He was
discharged to a rehab facility on [**11-18**] and had recently left
that facility and returned home last week. According to his
wife, he has been more sedated since discharge from the hospital
but otherwise has been doing relatively well at home. He
endorses chronic knee and LE pain but denies any recent CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, N/V, poor PO intake, progressive weakness,
paresthesias, HA, melena, or BRBPR. He has noticed some
intermittant painless shaking in his hands that has occasionally
caused him to drop objects. He and his wife note good compliance
with his medications though she had held his coreg until
yesterday given slow HR at home. She feels that his altered
mental status can be directly attributed to the doses of
narcotics that he was discharge on as this was a new medication
for him. He has been eating well at home but did not take good
PO today despite receiving his regular dose of insulin.
.
Today he presented to a neurology appointment for further
evaluation of his hand shaking and there was noted to be
somnolent. His blood pressure was in the 80s systolic and he was
sent to the ED for further evaluation. There he was seen to be
bradycardic to the low 50s and somnolent. His glucose level was
33 and he received D50 and promptly awoke and was appropriate
per report. His bradycardia was treated with atropine to which
his HR increased to the 70s and his relative hypotension
(systolic ~90) improved. EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] and reportedly felt
that no intervention was indicated at this time. He was admitted
to the ICU because his HR dipped to the low 50s for ~25 seconds
and it was felt that he merited intensive monitoring.

again from [**Hospital 99**] Rehab after the staff there had ""trouble
waking him up"" this AM, and found him to be in mixed respiratory
failure. On the prior admit, the pt was diagnosed with a LLL pna
and treated with vancomycin/zosyn. Per his wife, the patient was
doing relatively well last week, still in the MACU at [**Hospital 99**]
Rehab since his recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] but with a plan to
transition to the regular floor soon. His ABG on [**3264-5-14**] was
7.34/69/55 on room air, which is close to his baseline pCO2. On
Saturday 2d PTA, the pt's wife noted that he was congested more
than baseline, initially unable to cough, but then improved
after neb treatments with the production of brown-pink
secretions.  He had hyperglycemia to FS 223, which per wife he
has never had before (no h/o DM). By Saturday night though he
was doing well, less congested and speaking clearly. Then,
Sunday AM, he was congested again and though he received nebs he
was not able to cough out the secretions. Per the Pulmonologist
note from Sunday PM, he was then found to be poorly arousable,
with RR 30, shallow breathing, lungs clear, O2 sat 90% on pulse
oximeter. ABG performed, 7.20/107/44, O2 sat 68% on ABG,
presumably on room air though unclear. BIPAP was written for
(IPAP 16, EPAP 3), though it is not clear if this was started.
He was shortly thereafter intubated after the Pulmonologist
confirmed his Full Code status with the pt's wife. After
intubation, it was noted that he had copious thick yellow
secretions in his trachea, which were felt to be the culprit
causing obstruction and hypercarbia/hypoxemia. With suctioning
his breathing improved, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further work up. The patient remained awake the whole time. He
was noted to have a temp of 100.4F this AM.

60s-80s. His CXR was concerning to the ED staff for RUL/RLL
processes (though appears to have only persistent LLL , and he
was given CTX, Vanc, and Flagyl out of concern for nosocomial
vs. aspiration pna. His urine was leuk esterase (+) on UA,
culture pending. Blood cultures were also sent. He received 1L
NS for hypotension, and subsequently his pressures were still
low so he was started on a dopamine drip via a newly-placed RIJ

also had a 18G PIV placed, and has a PICC line from [**Hospital **] Rehab

812,"This is a 70-year-old man with
history of recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder, anemia and questionable celiac sprue who presented
with weakness and pallor of [**3-14**] weeks duration, followed by
decreased hematocrit and increased INR to the MICU.  In
[**2567-10-12**] the patient had a high retrograde urethral
catheter placed for BCG for recurrent transitional cell
carcinoma in his right renal pelvis.  He had a right
nephrostomy tube placed in [**11-11**].  He was treated every week;
his last treatment was approximately 2 weeks ago.  The day
after each treatment, the patient noticed rust colored urine
and frank blood in his urine for the subsequent 3-4 days.
Three to four weeks prior to admission, the patient has had
progressively worsening weakness and pallor.  Concurrently,
the patient had repeated episodes of diarrhea and lost
approximately 16 lbs in two weeks.  He did not experience any
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; he attributed his diarrhea
to celiac sprue aggravated by eating glutin containing foods.
After two weeks, the diarrhea resolved and the patient
regained some of his lost weight.  Shortly afterwards, he
began experiencing constipation and noticed that his stools
were black.  He denies any hematochezia, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting.  Since the patient thought his oral iron
therapy might be contributing this blackened stools,
approximately two weeks prior to this admission he stopped
taking oral iron that had been prescribed for his chronic
iron deficiency anemia.  The patient's fatigue persisted and
worsened progressively in the week prior to admission; he was
unable to climb up a flight of stairs due to exhaustion and
difficulty breathing.  Associated symptoms included dizziness
upon standing, increased bruising of his extremities, and
pallor of his face and extremities.  The patient has had no
prior personal or family history of a bleeding diathesis.  On
admission, the patient's wife found him lying on the ground
because of exhaustion and lightheadedness with facial pallor.
Upon admission to the Emergency Room, his vital signs were
blood pressure 80/33, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 14.
He received four units of packed red blood cells in the ER
since his hematocrit was found to be 10.  ABG showed PH 7.52,
PO2 106, PCO2 28.  The ABGs draw site blood for 15 minutes
despite pressure, his coags were PTT 150, PT 100, INR 69.
Lower extremity dopplers did not show evidence of DVT or
evidence of intravascular bleed.  The patient was transferred
to the MICU where he received 7 units of packed red blood
cells, Vitamin K 10 mg IV and one unit of FFP as well as
Keflex.  Abdominal and pelvis CT showed no evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed, no evidence of hydronephrosis or
perinephric fluid.  Additionally, the patient complained of
left leg soreness and progressive weakness since his catheter
placement in [**2567-10-12**].  The pain is located predominantly
along the lateral aspect of his left lower leg distal to his
knee; the pain is aggravated by movement and the weakness
makes it difficult for him to walk.  He does not feel any
numbness or paresthesias in his legs.  In the week prior to
admission, he developed swelling distal to his knee which
continued to persist.

717,"Patient is a 77F who had a primary left total hip replacement in
[**2918**] by another surgeon that sustained progressive protrusio
early, ultimately failing with loss of fixation of the
acetabulum. I brought [**Known patient firstname 5254**] to surgery a little over a year ago
at which time we felt that her best treatment option
intraoperatively would be allograft packing of the acetabulum
defect and a
hemiarthroplasty head. Also considered at the time was a
Restoration GAP prosthesis. She did well for probably 10 or 12
months and then started developing pain and x-rays demonstrated
progressive protrusio with the femoral head at risk for pushing
through the remnant of the acetabulum. We have also seen
insufficiency fractures developing on the pubic ramus and in the
posterior wall of the acetabulum. The patient is developing
progressive pain, unrelenting, and sciatic symptoms. She has
been made nonweightbearing a couple
months ago in preparation for the surgery. She understands this
is very much a salvage operation. She is developing progressive
fracturing from osteoporosis and there is very little bone stock
remaining. She is really not a candidate
for major allograft pelvic reconstruction as fixation would be
limited. Best treatment course, cemented GAP cage and avoidance
of further allograft.

washouts and hardware removal.  Her post-operative course was
extensive, but notable for GI bleeding presenting as falling
anemia, for which an EGD showed mild esophagitis managed with

extra medications reportedly ""by mistake."" The partner is pretty
sure that the patient was intoxicated when he multiple tablets
of wellbutrin, seroquel, propranolol and klonipin but he is
uncertain of specific amount. He later stated that he was not
absolutely certain whether the patient actually ingested any
wellbutrin and propanolol. Ultimately, the amount and
combination of pills taken was unclear. The patient's longtime

oxygen saturations <90. He was somnolent on arrival to hospital
but still responsive to tactile stimuli.  Fingerstick glucose
was 140 on arrival. He quickly became hypotensive to SBP 73/47.
He was given IVF x3L total. EKG was normal, without any alarming
ST changes. Peripheral dopamine was started for rapid BP
correction and he was intubated for hypoxia and airway
protection. Toxicology consult was called and they recommended
that the pressor choice be switched to Levofed. He was also
given narcan x2 with no effect. Once the medication history was
flushed out, he was given calcium which did increase his rate
from 58 to 88 and his SBP increased by 10. He was given glucagon
1mg with no further effect. Toxicology consult recommended
trying high dose glucagon 5mg and if that works, starting a
glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hr. They also recommend serial EKGs for
monitoring.  He was also given Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone due to
initial concern for possible sepsis.
.
He had chest xray which showed question widened mediastinum and
patient reported some chest discomfort on arrival. CTA was done
which showed normal aorta. FAST scan was done which showed no
pericardial effusion, and no intra-abdominal bleeds.  CXR/CT did
show bilateral infiltrates consistent with an aspiration.
Hemodynamic instability was worrisome and he was transferred to
the intensive care unit for close monitoring.

On arrival to the ICU he was hypoxic with O2 saturation of 85%
on FIO2 of 50%, HR in 50's.  He was suctioned, ET tube pulled
back 2cm and PEEP increased to 14, FIO2 to 100% with slow
recovery of O2 saturation. He was continued on Levophed and an

About 1.5 months ago, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7658**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] unemployed [**Hospital1 **]-afilliated
laborer, took a brief job helping clean sections of
sewage-coated areas of the Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant,
in which he used a large vacuum cleaner to clean sewage, ripe
with the smell of feces, out of trough-like areas of the plant.
He found this to be very physically demanding work, one of the
hardest jobs he's ever had in a work history marked mainly by
laborer and demolition work in construction, but he did not lose
his energy and additionally, he had [**Last Name **] problem bicycling to
work. When the job ended, about 3-4 weeks ago apparently
(although his timeline is not entirely consistent), he had a
large amount of cash on hand and used it to binge on crack
cocaine and Klonopins, the former being a frequent past drug of
choice for him, and the latter being a more unusual variation.
This run of drug use lasted about a week.
.
Apparently around the time this week ended he got what he
describes as ""a cold"" with some runny nose and cough; he says
that everyone in his rooming house got a cold, but he was the
only one not to get over it. 2 weeks ago he quit smoking. His
respiratory status gradually worsened, with more and more
difficulty breathing. Over the last week he has had little
appetite, even despite some efforts to smoke marijuana to
stimulate it; and he believes that he has lost weight. He has
had subjective fever symptoms of feeling cold and getting sweats
for several weeks.
.
He reports that earlier today he tried to take a shower, shave,
and brush his teeth; this required frequent stops to get his
breath and all told took about an hour and a half.

He has already been seen for cough and SOB with exertion. He was
seen by his primary care and HIV physician, [**Known patient firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2120**], on
[**9-12**]; he was prescribed an azithromycin z-pack and given the
regular flu vaccine. He also restarted his prior [**Month/Year (2) 2731**] regimen,
of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and emtricitabine-tenofovir, at
this time.
.
He was seen in the emergency department on [**9-16**], at which time
he had not started his z-pack, where he complained of productive
cough with yellow-green sputum, but without shortness of breath
or chest pain. He started his azithromycin then, after the ED
visit, and had continued to take it up until his admission on
[**9-20**]. He returned with still worse cough, shortness of breath,
and dyspnea with exertion.

was now taking them faithfully. He did discuss some instances in
